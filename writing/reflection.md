## Lab 01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word with your response.

### First Tool: Computer aided drug design

1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

It is used to validate drug targets, and help us understanding complex biological processes to improve drug discovery as well as development.

2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

Computer-aided drug design has signified as a dominant practice because of its proper algorithms including the development of digital repositories for the study of chemical interaction relationships, computer programs for designing compounds with unusual physicochemical characteristics as well as tools for systematic assessment of potential lead candidates in drug discovery and development. Thanks to this, we are now using medicines that are used to treat malaria, HIV as well as influenza against SARS-CoV-2.

3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

I think this tool is very important to develop because it enables us to develop new effective, powerful medicines in a swift manner. Consider that there still exists diseases that we don't have a specific way to treat it, it seems vital to me that we have tools that can use in develop medicines/drugs that can effectively deal with these dangerous diseases.

4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

First of all, current computer systems cannot totally simulate the entire real biological systems of real, living beings. Therefore, over-dependence on these computer models might lead to inaccurate results if the model itself is not adjusted closely enough to the targeted

### Second Tool: Genome-wide association study

1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

It is used to rehabilitate the complex disease genetics into modest by providing various convincing links between complex characteristics of human and disease. It has involved in the screening of genetic variants across the genomes of many individuals to identify genotype-phenotype associations. Genetic variants discovered by GWAS are used to identify individuals at high risk of deadly diseases, which influences the early detection and prevention of diseases

2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

A genome wide association study (GWAS) is an extensive genetic analysis of the disease-associated observable alleles in the host/pathogen in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) The use of GWAS applications including sequence analysis,alignment, genetic/nucleotide variations in the form of SNPs, genomic
structure and alterations, primer design etc. have represented novelinsights in case of SARS-CoV-2 experiments by accurately detect and quantify rare viral variants within the species.

3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

I think this method is important because since most of our diseases at this point usually comes from an external genetic factor, or via changes in our DNA that are not compatible to our system, the genome-wide association study will help us in understanding the base of our problems, giving us ways and means to detect them early on in order to treat them effectively. Also, we can study the trends behind the proteins that cause these diseases to happen, so that we can figure out a way to prevent them from happening.

4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

A flaw of this method is that the appearance of certain signs doesn't necessarily mean that they are the genomes that cause the disease to happen. This doesn't necessarily mean that genome-wide association study is fundamentally flawed, however, this could misled scientists, therefore leads to the inefficiency in treatment as well as lack of accurate understanding on the cause of certain diseases.
